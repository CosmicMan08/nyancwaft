ca kitty ckatiy kciaty ckiat resource pack for minecwaft

The end goal of this project is to change a significant portion of textures in the game to be cat related

Anything is fair game really, though i'd prefer not to change basic terrain like grass to have cats thrown all over them, we're not going for SM64 OwOify here lol

anyone is free to submit textures, that's why it's on github
