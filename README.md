ca kitty ckatiy kciaty ckiat resource pack for minecwaft

end goal is to change a significant portion of textures in the game to be cat related
anything is fair game really, though i'd prefer not to change basic terrain like grass to have cats thrown all over them, we're not going for sm64 owoify here lol
anyone is free to submit textures that's why it's on github
